# customer_churn_prediction
Project Summary

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (stop using a service). Churn prediction is important for companies like telecom providers or subscription services because retaining existing customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones.

In this project, I used a real-world customer dataset to train different machine learning models that classify customers as likely to churn or stay. I tried multiple models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost and compared their performance.
